# docs/deliverable_docs
This folder gives us a single point to store final versions of customer or conference presentations related to this engagement. As the repo will become large if you store Word, ppt, etc. files (especially if these are changing over time), please only store final documents here and utilize another location such as a Sharepoint for working documents of that nature.

For this project, we have those deliverable documents:
- ProjectReport: A summary of this project
- Step_By_Step_Tutorial: a detailed instructions on how to run this sample
- BlogPost: a blog post article that is prepared for publish

# Use word embeddings to predict Twitter sentiment following Team Data Science Process

### [Use word embeddings to predict Twitter sentiment following Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/preview/scenario-tdsp-twitter-sentiment)

The primary purpose of this tutorial is to show how to instantiate and execute a machine learning project using the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) structure and templates in Azure Machine Learning Work Bench. For this purpose, we use [Twitter Sentiment data](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip). The modeling task is to predict sentiment polarity (positive or negative) using the text from tweets.

In this walkthrough, we demonstrate the usage of Word Embedding algorithms like Word2Vec algorithm and Sentiment Specfic Word Embedding (SSWE) Algorithm to predict Twitter sentiment in Azure Machine Learning Workbench. The trained model is deployed to a web service using Azure Container Service(ACS). We are following Team Data Science Process to execute this project.

This walkthrough is executed using TDSP templates which consist of the following parts: 

- [Data acquisition and understanding](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/01_data_acquisition_and_understanding)

- [Modeling](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/02_modeling)
    - Feature Engineering
    - Model Creation
    - Model Evaluation

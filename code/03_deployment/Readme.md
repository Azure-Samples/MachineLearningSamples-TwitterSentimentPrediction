This part we will deploy pre-trained sentiment prediction model (SSWE embedding + GBM model) to a web service on a cluster in the Azure Container Service (ACS). The operationalization environment provisions Docker and Kubernetes in the cluster to manage the web-service deployment. You can find further information on the operationalization process [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-service-deploy).

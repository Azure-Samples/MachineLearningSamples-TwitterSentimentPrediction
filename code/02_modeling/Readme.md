This part of the tutorial is further divided into three subparts: 
- **Feature Engineering** corresponds to the generation of features using different word embedding algorithms. 
- **Model Creation** deals with the training of different models like _logistic regression_ and _gradient boosting_ to predict sentiment of the input text. 
- **Model Evaluation** applies the trained model over the testing data.

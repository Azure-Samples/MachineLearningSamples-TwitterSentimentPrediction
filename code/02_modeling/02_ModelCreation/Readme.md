Once the word vectors have been generated using either of the SSWE or Word2vec algorithm, this step is to train the classification models to predict actual sentiment polarity. We apply the two types of features: Word2Vec and SSWE into two models: GBM model and Logistic regression model. Therefore we have four models trained.
